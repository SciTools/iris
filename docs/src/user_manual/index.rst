User Manual
===========

Welcome to the Iris User Manual!

We encourage exploring our User Manual pages using the tabbed sections below,
which combine the `Diataxis`_ framework and topic-based filters to find content
best suited to your purpose today. Alternatively, you can use the sidebar to
navigate by section.

.. todo:
   Should the sections also be offered as another Diataxis tab? This would allow
   topic-based filtering, and allow all pages to be found through the same
   route.
