Reviewing the Iris User Experience
**********************************

.. todo:: https://github.com/SciTools/iris/issues/6867; this page belongs in 'Get Involved'

Often, improving and updating the existing user experience can fall behind fixing create new features,
or quashing pesky bugs. To combat this, we plan to have regular development discussions to ensure
UX doesn't fall behind. These pages offer some insight into what sort of things we might be discussing,
and hopefully offers some extra transparency behind our development process.

Below are some potential topics to guide future discussions on the Iris user experience.

.. note::

    If you have any thoughts or comments on either the user experience of Iris, or on this page,
    please create a GitHub discussion, or comment in an existing one
    (`See our UX discussion! <https://github.com/SciTools/iris/discussions/6594>`__)!

    We'd love to hear from you!
