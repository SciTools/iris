User Guide
==========

Below is the original User Guide, written in a linear narrative style. Reading
through this will give you a comprehensive grounding in Iris' data model and
functionality.

Much of the content has supplementary links to the reference documentation;
you will not need to follow these links in order to understand the guide but
they may serve as a useful reference for future exploration.

   Since later pages depend on earlier ones, try reading this user guide
   sequentially using the ``next`` and ``previous`` links at the bottom
   of each page.

.. note:: 
   
   There is also useful learning material held in the
   https://github.com/scitools-classroom repo, including tutorials, courses
   and presentations.
