User Guide
==========

If you are reading this user guide for the first time it is strongly
recommended that you read the user guide fully before experimenting with your
own data files.

Much of the content has supplementary links to the reference documentation;
you will not need to follow these links in order to understand the guide but
they may serve as a useful reference for future exploration.

.. only:: html

   Since later pages depend on earlier ones, try reading this user guide
   sequentially using the ``next`` and ``previous`` links at the bottom
   of each page.

.. note:: 
   
   There is also useful learning material held in the
   https://github.com/scitools-classroom repo, including tutorials, courses
   and presentations.
