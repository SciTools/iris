Reviewing the Iris User Experience
**********************************

Often, improving and updating the existing user experience can fall behind fixing create new features,
or quashing pesky bugs. To combat this, we plan to have regular development discussions to ensure
UX doesn't fall behind. These pages offer some insight into what sort of things we might be discussing,
and hopefully offers some extra transparency behind our development process.

..note ::

    If you have any thoughts or comments on either the user experience of Iris, or on this page,
    please create a GitHub discussion, or comment in an existing one! We'd love to hear from you!
