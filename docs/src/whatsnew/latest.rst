üì¢ Announcements
================

#. Iris is now compliant with NumPy v2. This may affect your scripts.
   :ref:`See the full What's New entry for more details <numpy2>`.


‚ú® Features
===========

#. `@jrackham-mo`_ added :meth:`~iris.io.format_picker.FormatAgent.copy` and
   equality methods to :class:`iris.io.format_picker.FormatAgent`, as requested
   in :issue:`6108`, actioned in :pull:`6119`.

#. `@ukmo-ccbunney`_ added ``colorbar`` keyword to allow optional creation of
   the colorbar in the following quickplot methods:

   * :meth:`iris.quickplot.contourf`

   * :meth:`iris.quickplot.pcolor`

   * :meth:`iris.quickplot.pcolormesh`

   Requested in :issue:`5970`, actioned in :pull:`6169`.

#. `@pp-mo`_ and `@stephenworsley`_ added support for hybrid coordinates whose
   references are split across multiple input fields, and :meth:`~iris.LOAD_POLICY` to
   control it, as requested in :issue:`5369`, actioned in :pull:`6168`.

#. `@ESadek-MO`_ has updated :mod:`iris.fileformats.pp_save_rules` and
   :mod:`iris.fileformats.pp` to include the `label_surface_fields` flag across
   relevant functions, most notably :func:`iris.fileformats.pp.save`.
   This allows the user to choose whether or not surface fields are recognised
   and handled appropriately. (:issue:`3280`, :pull:`5734`)

üêõ Bugs Fixed
=============

#. `@rcomer`_ enabled partial collapse of multi-dimensional string coordinates,
   fixing :issue:`3653`. (:pull:`5955`)

#. `@bouweandela`_ made further updates to the ``chunktype`` of Dask arrays,
   so it corresponds better with the array content. (:pull:`5989`)

#. `@ukmo-ccbunney`_ improved error handling for malformed `cell_method`
   attribute. Also made cell_method string parsing more lenient w.r.t.
   whitespace. (:pull:`6083`)

#. `@ukmo-ccbunney`_ fixed comparison of cubes with array type attributes;
   fixes :issue:`6027` (:pull:`6181`)

üí£ Incompatible Changes
=======================

#. N/A


üöÄ Performance Enhancements
===========================

#. `@bouweandela`_ made the time coordinate categorisation functions in
   :mod:`~iris.coord_categorisation` faster. Anyone using
   :func:`~iris.coord_categorisation.add_categorised_coord`
   with cftime :class:`~cftime.datetime` objects can benefit from the same
   improvement by adding a type hint to their category funcion. (:pull:`5999`)

#. `@bouweandela`_ made :meth:`iris.cube.CubeList.concatenate` faster if more
   than two cubes are concatenated with equality checks on the values of
   auxiliary coordinates, derived coordinates, cell measures, or ancillary
   variables enabled.
   In some cases, this may lead to higher memory use. This can be remedied by
   reducing the number of Dask workers.
   In rare cases, the new implementation could potentially be slower. This
   may happen when there are very many or large auxiliary coordinates, derived
   coordinates, cell measures, or ancillary variables to be checked that span
   the concatenation axis. This issue can be avoided by disabling the
   problematic check. (:pull:`5926` and :pull:`6187`)

üî• Deprecations
===============

#. N/A


üîó Dependencies
===============

.. _numpy2:

#. `@trexfeathers`_ adapted the Iris codebase to work with NumPy v2. The
   `NumPy v2 full release notes`_ have the exhaustive details. Notable
   changes that may affect your Iris scripts are below. (:pull:`6035`)

   * `NumPy v2 changed data type promotion`_

   * `NumPy v2 changed scalar printing`_


üìö Documentation
================

#. `@bouweandela`_ added type hints for :class:`~iris.cube.Cube`. (:pull:`6037`)

#. `@ESadek-MO`_ has updated :ref:`um_files_loading` to include a short description
   of the new `label_surface_fields` functionality. (:pull:`5734`)


üíº Internal
===========

#. `@trexfeathers`_ improved the new ``tracemalloc`` benchmarking (introduced
   in Iris v3.10.0, :pull:`5948`) to use the same statistical repeat strategy
   as timing benchmarks. (:pull:`5981`)

#. `@trexfeathers`_ adapted Iris to work with Cartopy v0.24. (:pull:`6171`,
   :pull:`6172`)

#. `@trexfeathers`_ refactored spanning checks in :mod:`iris.fileformats.cf`
   to reduce code duplication. (:pull:`6196`)
