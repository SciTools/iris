📢 Announcements
================

#. N/A


✨ Features
===========

#. N/A

#. `@pp-mo`_ added a new utility function :func:`~iris.util.equalise_cubes`, to help
   with aligning cubes so they can merge / concatenate.
   (:issue:`6248`, :pull:`6257`)


#. `@fnattino`_ added the lazy median aggregator :class:`iris.analysis.MEDIAN`
   based on the implementation discussed by `@rcomer`_ and `@stefsmeets`_ in
   :issue:`4039` (:pull:`6167`).


🐛 Bugs Fixed
=============

#. `@rcomer`_ added handling for string stash codes when saving pp files.
   (:issue:`6239`, :pull:`6289`)


💣 Incompatible Changes
=======================

#. :class:`iris.tests.IrisTest` is being replaced by :mod:`iris.tests._shared_utils`.
   Once conversion from unittest to pytest is completed, :class:`iris.tests.IrisTest`
   class will be deprecated.


🚀 Performance Enhancements
===========================

#. N/A

#. `@fnattino`_ enabled lazy cube interpolation using the linear and
   nearest-neighbour interpolators (:class:`iris.analysis.Linear` and
   :class:`iris.analysis.Nearest`). Note that this implementation removes
   performance benefits linked to caching an interpolator object. While this does
   not break previously suggested code (instantiating and re-using an interpolator
   object remains possible), this is no longer an advertised feature. (:pull:`6084`)


🔥 Deprecations
===============

#. N/A


🔗 Dependencies
===============

#. N/A


📚 Documentation
================

#. `@ESadek-MO`_ and `@trexfeathers`_ created :ref:`contributing_pytest_conversions`
   as a guide for converting from ``unittest`` to ``pytest``. (:pull:`5785`)

#. `@ESadek-MO`_ and `@trexfeathers`_ created a style guide for ``pytest`` tests,
   and consolidated ``Test Categories`` and ``Testing Tools`` into
   :ref:`contributing_tests` (:issue:`5574`, :pull:`5785`)


💼 Internal
===========

#. `@ESadek-MO`_ `@pp-mo`_ `@bjlittle`_ `@trexfeathers`_ and `@HGWright`_ have
   converted around a third of Iris' ``unittest`` style tests to ``pytest``. This is
   part of an ongoing effort to move from ``unittest`` to ``pytest``. (:pull:`6207`,
   part of :issue:`6212`)

#. `@trexfeathers`_, `@ESadek-MO`_ and `@HGWright`_ heavily re-worked
   :doc:`/developers_guide/release_do_nothing` to be more thorough and apply
   lessons learned from recent releases. (:pull:`6062`)
