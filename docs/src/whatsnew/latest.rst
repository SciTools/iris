üì¢ Announcements
================

#. N/A


‚ú® Features
===========

#. `@pp-mo`_ added a new utility function for making a test cube with a specified 2D
   horizontal grid.
   (:issue:`5770`, :pull:`6581`)

#. `@bjlittle`_ extended ``zlib`` compression of :class:`~iris.cube.Cube` data
   payload when saving to NetCDF to also include any attached `CF-UGRID`_
   :class:`~iris.mesh.components.MeshXY`. Additionally,
   :func:`~iris.fileformats.netcdf.saver.save_mesh` also supports ``zlib``
   compression. (:issue:`6565`, :pull:`6728`)

#. `@ukmo-ccbunney`_ added a new :class:`~iris.util.CML_Settings` class to control
   the formatting of Cube CML output via a context manager.
   (:issue:`6244`, :pull:`6743`)


üêõ Bugs Fixed
=============

#. `@trexfeathers`_ corrected the ESMF/ESMPy import in
   :mod:`iris.experimental.regrid_conservative` (the module was renamed to ESMPy
   in v8.4). Note that :mod:`~iris.experimental.regrid_conservative`
   is already deprecated and will be removed in a future release. (:pull:`6643`)

#. `@rcomer`_ fixed a bug in merging cubes with cell measures or ancillary
   variables. The merged cube now has the cell measures and ancillary variables
   on the correct dimensions, and merge no longer fails when trying to add
   them to a dimension of the wrong length. (:issue:`2076`, :pull:`6688`)

#. `@bjlittle`_ added support for preserving masked auxiliary coordinates when
   using :meth:`~iris.cube.Cube.aggregated_by` or :meth:`~iris.cube.Cube.collapsed`.
   (:issue:`6473`, :pull:`6706`, :pull:`6719`)

üìö Documentation
================

#. `@rcomer`_ updated all Cartopy references to point to the new location at
   https://cartopy.readthedocs.io (:pull:`6636`)


üíº Internal
===========

#. `@trexfeathers`_ fixed benchmark result comparison to inspect the results
   for the current machine only. This is useful for setups where a single
   home-space is shared between multiple machines, as with some virtual desktop
   arrangements. (:pull:`6550`)

#. `@melissaKG`_ upgraded Iris' tests to no longer use the deprecated
   ``git whatchanged`` command. (:pull:`6672`)

#. `@ukmo-ccbunney` merged functionality of ``assert_CML_approx_data`` into
   ``assert_CML`` via the use of a new ``approx_data`` keyword. (:pull:`6713`)

#. `@ukmo-ccbunney` ``assert_CML`` now uses stricter array formatting to avoid
   changes in tests due to Numpy version changes. (:pull:`6743`)
