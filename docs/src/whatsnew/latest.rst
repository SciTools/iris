📢 Announcements
================

#. N/A


✨ Features
===========

#. `@pp-mo`_ added a new utility function for making a test cube with a specified 2D
   horizontal grid.
   (:issue:`5770`, :pull:`6581`)

#. `@hsteptoe <https://github.com/hsteptoe>`_ and `@...`_ (reviewer) extended :func:`iris.util.mask_cube_from_shapefile`
   to handle additional Point and Line shape types.  This change also facilitates the use of shapefiles that 
   use a different projection system to the cube that they are being applied to, and makes performance improvements
   to the mask weighting calculations. (:issue:`6126`, :pull:`6129`).  

🐛 Bugs Fixed
=============

#. `@trexfeathers`_ corrected the ESMF/ESMPy import in
   :mod:`iris.experimental.regrid_conservative` (the module was renamed to ESMPy
   in v8.4). Note that :mod:`~iris.experimental.regrid_conservative`
   is already deprecated and will be removed in a future release. (:pull:`6643`)

#. `@rcomer`_ fixed a bug in merging cubes with cell measures or ancillary
   variables. The merged cube now has the cell measures and ancillary variables
   on the correct dimensions, and merge no longer fails when trying to add
   them to a dimension of the wrong length. (:issue:`2076`, :pull:`6688`)


💣 Incompatible Changes
=======================

#. N/A


🚀 Performance Enhancements
===========================

#. N/A


🔥 Deprecations
===============

#. N/A


🔗 Dependencies
===============

#. `@hsteptoe <https://github.com/hsteptoe>`_ added `rasterio <https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_ 
   and `affiine <https://affine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ as a dependency for :func:`iris.util.mask_cube_from_shapefile`. 
   This is to support the new functionality of handling additional shapefiles and projections. (:issue:`6126`, :pull:`6129`)

📚 Documentation
================

#. `@rcomer`_ updated all Cartopy references to point to the new location at
   https://cartopy.readthedocs.io (:pull:`6636`)

#. `@hsteptoe <https://github.com/hsteptoe>`_ added additional worked examples
   to the :ref:`iris.util.mask_cube_from_shapefile` documentation, to demonstrate
   how to use the function with different types of shapefiles. (:pull:`6129`)


💼 Internal
===========

#. `@trexfeathers`_ fixed benchmark result comparison to inspect the results
   for the current machine only. This is useful for setups where a single
   home-space is shared between multiple machines, as with some virtual desktop
   arrangements. (:pull:`6550`)

#. `@melissaKG`_ upgraded Iris' tests to no longer use the deprecated
   ``git whatchanged`` command. (:pull:`6672`)
