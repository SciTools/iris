📢 Announcements
================

#. `@bjlittle`_ migrated the ``SciTools`` social community from ``X`` (formally ``Twitter``)
   to `Bluesky <https://bsky.app/profile/scitools.bsky.social>`__ 🦋. (:pull:`6237`)


✨ Features
===========

#. `@trexfeathers`_ and `@ukmo-ccbunney`_ extended the
   :data:`iris.loading.LOAD_PROBLEMS` capturing to _all_ NetCDF objects that are
   added to a :class:`~iris.cube.Cube` during loading, as well as a selection
   of other objects such as :class:`~iris.coord_systems.CoordSystem`. Note this
   includes an improvement to how :class:`~iris.coords.DimCoord` is 'gracefully'
   converted to :class:`~iris.coords.AuxCoord` if it is masked - the mask is
   now preserved when it was not previously.

#. `@wjbenfold`_ and `@trexfeathers`_ added ``crs_wkt`` to the attributes when
   saving a :class:`~iris.coord_systems.CoordSystem` to a NetCDF file. Note that
   ``crs_wkt`` is considered *supplementary* by the CF conventions, with
   ``grid_mapping`` being the primary source of information, and ``crs_wkt`` not
   expected to contain conflicting information. Because of this, Iris generates
   :class:`~iris.coord_systems.CoordSystem` exclusively from ``grid_mapping``
   when loading, and writes a fresh ``crs_wkt`` whenever a
   :class:`~iris.coord_systems.CoordSystem` is saved. If your use case goes
   beyond the CF conventions, you can modify the save and load process for your
   needs by using the `Ncdata`_ package.
   See `CRS WKT in the CF Conventions`_ for more. (:issue:`3796`, :pull:`6519`)


🐛 Bugs Fixed
=============

#. `@HGWright`_ added a new warning to inform users that the boolean coordinate generated by
   :meth:`iris.coord_categorisation.add_season_membership` is not saveable to netcdf. (:pull:`6305`)

#. `@bouweandela`_ changed the ``convert_units`` method on cubes and coordinates
   so it also converts the values of the attributes ``"actual_range"``,
   ``"valid_max"``, ``"valid_min"``, and ``"valid_range"``. (:pull:`6416`)

#. `@ukmo-ccbunney`_ fixed loading and merging of masked data in scalar ``AuxCoords``.
   (:issue:`3584`, :pull:`6468`)

#. `@stephenworsley`_ fixed the html representation of cubes in Jupyter when coordinates
   share the same name. (:pull:`6476`)

#. `@trexfeathers`_ added a CI workflow to quickly validate that the
   benchmarking setup is still working. (:pull:`6496`)
