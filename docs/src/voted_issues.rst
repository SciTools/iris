Voted Issues
============

You can help us to prioritise development of new features by leaving a üëç
reaction on the header (not subsequent comments) of any issue.

.. tip:: We suggest you subscribe to the issue so you will be updated.
         When viewing the issue there is a **Notifications**
         section where you can select to subscribe.

Below is a sorted table of all issues that have 1 or more üëç from our github
project.  Please note that there is more development activity than what is on
the below table.
