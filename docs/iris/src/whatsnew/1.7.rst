Bugs fixed

Incompatible changes
====================

* Saving a cube with a STASH attribute to NetCDF now produces a variable
  with an attribute of "um_stash_source" rather than "ukmo__um_stash_source".
* Cubes save to NetCDF with a coordinate system referencing a spherical ellipsoid
  now result in the grid mapping variable containing only the "earth_radius" attribute,
  rather than the "semi_major_axis" and "semi_minor_axis".
