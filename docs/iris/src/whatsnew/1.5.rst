What's new in Iris 1.5
**********************

:Release: 1.5.0
:Date: 12 September 2013


Iris 1.5 features
=================
* Scatter plots can now be produced using :func:`iris.plot.scatter` and
  :func:`iris.quickplot.scatter`.
* The functions :func:`iris.plot.plot` and :func:`iris.quickplot.plot` now take
  up to two arguments, which may be cubes or coordinates, allowing the user to
  have full control over what is plotted on each axis. The coords keyword
  argument is now deprecated for these functions.  This now also gives extended
  1D plotting capability.

  .. code-block:: python
  
      # plot a 1d cube against a given 1d coordinate, with the cube
      # values on the x-axis and the coordinate on the y-axis
      iris.plot.plot(cube, coord)

* :class:`iris.analysis.SUM` is now a weighted aggregator, allowing it to take a
  weights keyword argument.
* GRIB2 translations added for standard_name 'soil_temperature'.
* :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.slices` can now handle passing dimension index as well
  as the currently supported types (string, coordinate), in order to slice in
  cases where there is no coordinate associated with a dimension (a mix of
  types is also supported).

  .. code-block:: python
  
      # Get cube slices corresponding to the dimension associated with longitude
      # and the first dimension from a multi-dimensional cube.
      for sub_cube in cube.slices(['longitude', 0]):
          print sub_cube

* :mod:`iris.experimental.animate` now provides experimental animation support.

  .. code-block:: python
  
      # Create an iterable of cubes (generator, lists etc.)
      cube_iter = cubes.slices(('grid_longitude', 'grid_latitude'))
      ani = animate(cube_iter, qplt.contourf)
      plt.show()

* Support for UM ancillary files truncated with the UM utility ieee
* Complete support for Transverse Mercator with saving to NetCDF also.

  .. code-block:: python
  
      import cartopy.crs as ccrs
      import iris
      import iris.quickplot as qplt
      import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  
  
      fname = iris.sample_data_path('air_temp.pp')
      temperature = iris.load_cube(fname)
  
      plt.axes(projection=ccrs.TransverseMercator())
      qplt.contourf(temperature)
      plt.gca().coastlines()
      plt.gca().gridlines()
      plt.show()
  
  .. image:: pics/transverse_merc.png

* Support for loading NAME files (gridded and trajectory data).
* Multi-dimensional coordinate support added for
  :func:`iris.analysis.cartography.cosine_latitude_weights`
* Added limited packaged GRIB support (bulletin headers).
* In-place keyword added to :func:`iris.analysis.maths.divide` and
  :func:`iris.analysis.maths.multiply`.
* Performance gains for PP loading of the order of 40%.
* :mod:`iris.quickplot` now has a :func:`~iris.quickplot.show` function to
  provide convenient access to matplotlib.pyplot.show().
* :meth:`iris.coords.DimCoord.from_regular` now implemented which creates a
  :class:`~iris.coords.DimCoord` with regularly spaced points, and optionally
  bounds.
* Iris can now cope with a missing bounds variable from NetCDF files.
* Added support for bool array indexing on a cube.

  .. code-block:: python
  
      fname = iris.sample_data_path('air_temp.pp')
      temperature = iris.load_cube(fname)
      temperature[temperature.coord('latitude').points > 0]
  
      # The constraints mechanism is still the preferred means to do such a query.
      temperature.extract(iris.Constraint(latitude=lambda v: v>0)))

* Added support for loading fields defined on regular Gaussian grids from GRIB
  files.
* :func:`iris.analysis.interpolate.extract_nearest_neighbour` now works
  without needing to load the data (especially relevant to large datasets).
* When using plotting routines from :mod:`iris.plot` or :mod:`iris.quickplot`,
  the direction of vertical axes will be reversed if the corresponding
  coordinate has a "positive" attribute set to "down".

  see: :ref:`graphics-atlantic_profiles`

* New PP stashcode translations added including 'dewpoint' and
  'relative_humidity'.
* Added implied heights for several common PP STASH codes.
* GeoTIFF export capability enhanced for supporting various data types, coord
  systems and mapping 0 to 360 longitudes to the -180 to 180 range.


Bugs fixed
----------
* NetCDF error handling on save has been extended to capture file path and
  permission errors.
* Shape of the Earth scale factors are now correctly interpreted by the GRIB
  loader. They were previously used as a multiplier for the given value but
  should have been used as a decimal shift.
* OSGB definition corrected.
* Transverse Mercator on load now accepts the following interchangeably due to
  inconsistencies in CF documentation:
   * +scale_factor_at_central_meridian <-> scale_factor_at_projection_origin
   * +longitude_of_central_meridian <-> longitude_of_projection_origin
  (+recommended encoding)
* Ellipse description now maintained when converting GeogCS to cartopy.
* GeoTIFF export bug fixes.
* Polar axis now set to the North Pole, when a cube with no coordinate system
  is saved to the PP file-format.
* :meth:`iris.coords.DimCoord.from_coord` and
  :meth:`iris.coords.AuxCoord.from_coord` now correctly returns a copy of the
  source coordinate's coordinate system.
* Units part of the axis label is now omitted when the coordinate it represents
  is given as a time reference (:mod:`iris.quickplot`).
* CF dimension coordinate is now maintained in the resulting cube when a cube
  with CF dimension coordinate is being aggregated over.
* Units for Lambert conformal and polar stereographic coordinates now defined as
  meters.
* Various fieldsfile load bugs including failing to read the coordinates from
  the file have been fixed.
* Coding of maximum and minimum time-stats in GRIB2 saving has been fixed.
* Example code in section 4.1 of the userguide updated so it uses a sample
  data file that exists.
* Zorder of contour lines drawn by :func:`~iris.plot.contourf` has been changed
  to address issue of objects appearing in-between line and filled contours.
* Coord comparisons now function correctly when comparing to numpy scalars.
* Cube loading constraints and :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.extract` correctly
  implement cell equality methods.


Incompatible changes
--------------------
* N/A


Deprecations
------------
* The coords keyword argument for :func:`iris.plot.plot` and
  :func:`iris.quickplot.plot` has been deprecated due to the new API which
  accepts multiple cubes or coordinates.
* :meth:`iris.fileformats.pp.PPField.regular_points` and
  :meth:`iris.fileformats.pp.PPField.regular_bounds` have now been deprecated
  in favour of a new factory method
  :meth:`iris.coords.DimCoord.from_regular()`.
* :func:`iris.fileformats.pp.add_load_rules` and
  :func:`iris.fileformats.grib.add_load_rules` are now deprecated.
