What's new in Iris 1.2
**********************

:Release: 1.2.0
:Date: unreleased

This document explains the new/changed features of Iris in version 1.2.

Iris 1.2 features
=================

A summary of the main features added with version 1.2:

* :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.convert_units()` and
  :meth:`iris.coords.Coord.convert_units()` have been added. This is
  aimed at simplifying the conversion of a cube or coordinate from one unit to
  another. For example, to convert a cube in kelvin to celsius, one can now
  call cube.convert_units('celsius'). The operation is in-place and if the
  units are not convertible an exception will be raised.
* :attr:`iris.cube.Cube.var_name`, :attr:`iris.coords.Coord.var_name` and
  :attr:`iris.aux_factory.AuxCoordFactory.var_name` attributes have been added.
  This attribute represents the CF variable name of the object. It is populated
  when loading from CF-netCDF files and is used when writing to CF-netCDF. A
  var_name keyword argument has also been added to the
  :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.coord()`, :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.coords()` and
  :meth:`iris.cube.Cube.aux_factory()` methods.

Bugs fixed
----------
* N/A

Incompatible changes
--------------------
* The deprecated :attr:`iris.cube.Cube.unit` and :attr:`iris.coords.Coord.unit`
  attributes have been removed.

Deprecations
------------
* The :meth:`iris.coords.Coord.unit_converted()` method has been deprecated.
  Users should make a copy of the coordinate using
  :meth:`iris.coords.Coord.copy()` and then call the
  :meth:`iris.coords.Coord.convert_units()` method of the new coordinate.
* With the addition of the var_name attribute the signatures of DimCoord and
  AuxCoord have changed. This should have no impact if you are providing
  parameters as keyword arguments, but it may cause issues if you are relying
  on the position/order of the arguments.
