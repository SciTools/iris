What's new in Iris 1.2
**********************

:Release: 1.2.0
:Date: unreleased

This document explains the new/changed features of Iris in version 1.2.

Iris 1.2 features
=================

A summary of the main features added with version 1.2:

* A convert_units() method has been added to both cubes and coordinates. This
  is aimed at simplifying the conversion of a cube or coordinate from one unit
  to another. For example, to convert a cube in kelvin to celsius, one can now
  call cube.convert_units('celsius'). The operation is in-place and if the
  units are not convertible an exception will be raised.

Bugs fixed
----------
* N/A

Incompatible changes
--------------------
* The deprecated Cube.unit and Coord.unit attributes have been removed.

Deprecations
------------
* The Coord.unit_converted method has been deprecated. Users should make a
  copy of the coordinate using Coord.copy() and then call the
  convert_units method of the new coordinate.
