# benchmark_this automatically triggers the benchmark workflow when added by
#  a user. No triggering happens when GitHub Actions adds the label (this
#  avoids security vulnerabilities), so alternative triggers for the below
#  files are therefore included in workflows/benchmarks_run.yml. Automatic
#  labelling is still included here to make it easier to search pull requests,
#  and to reinforce the culture of using this label.
