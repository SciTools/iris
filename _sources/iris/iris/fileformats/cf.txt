A CF-netCDF ancillary data variable is a variable that provides metadata
about the individual values of another data variable.

Identified by the CF-netCDF variable attribute 'ancillary_variables'.

----------

A CF-netCDF auxiliary coordinate variable is any netCDF variable that contains
coordinate data, but is not a CF-netCDF coordinate variable by definition.

There is no relationship between the name of a CF-netCDF auxiliary coordinate
variable and the name(s) of its dimension(s).

Identified by the CF-netCDF variable attribute 'coordinates'.
Also see :class:`iris.fileformats.cf.CFLabelVariable`.

----------

A CF-netCDF boundary variable is associated with a CF-netCDF variable that contains
coordinate data. When a data value provides information about conditions in a cell
occupying a region of space/time or some other dimension, the boundary variable
provides a description of cell extent.

A CF-netCDF boundary variable will have one more dimension than its associated
CF-netCDF coordinate variable or CF-netCDF auxiliary coordinate variable.

Identified by the CF-netCDF variable attribute 'bounds'.

----------

A CF-netCDF climatology variable is associated with a CF-netCDF variable that contains
coordinate data. When a data value provides information about conditions in a cell
occupying a region of space/time or some other dimension, the climatology variable
provides a climatological description of cell extent.

A CF-netCDF climatology variable will have one more dimension than its associated
CF-netCDF coordinate variable.

Identified by the CF-netCDF variable attribute 'climatology'.

----------

A CF-netCDF coordinate variable is a one-dimensional variable with the same name
as its dimension, and it is defined as a numeric data type with values that are
ordered monotonically. Missing values are not allowed in CF-netCDF coordinate
variables. Also see [NUG] Section 2.3.1.

Identified by the above criterion, there is no associated CF-netCDF variable
attribute.

----------

A CF-netCDF grid mapping variable contains a list of specific attributes that
define a particular grid mapping. A CF-netCDF grid mapping variable must contain
the attribute 'grid_mapping_name'.

Based on the value of the 'grid_mapping_name' attribute, there are associated
standard names of CF-netCDF coordinate variables that contain the mapping's
independent variables.

Identified by the CF-netCDF variable attribute 'grid_mapping'.

A CF-netCDF CF label variable is any netCDF variable that contain string
textual information, or labels.
