      <description>Global average sea level change is due to change in volume of the water in the ocean, caused by mass and/or density change, or to change in the volume of the ocean basins, caused by tectonics etc. It is sometimes called &quot;eustatic&quot;, which is a term that also has other definitions. It differs from the change in the global average sea surface height relative to the centre of the Earth by the global average vertical movement of the ocean floor. Zero sea level change is an arbitrary level. Amplitude is the magnitude of a wave modelled by a sinusoidal function. A coordinate variable of harmonic_period can be used to specify the period of the sinusoidal wave.</description>

The list of individual species that are included in a quantity with a group chemical standard name can vary between models.  Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. &quot;Inorganic chlorine&quot;, sometimes referred to as Cly, describes a family of chemical species which result from the degradation of source gases containing chlorine (CFCs, HCFCs, VSLS) and natural inorganic chlorine sources such as seasalt and other aerosols.   Standard names that use the term &quot;inorganic_chlorine&quot; are used for quantities that contain all inorganic chlorine species including HCl and ClONO2. The phrase &#39;expressed_as&#39; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A.</description>

The atmosphere optical thickness applies to radiation passing through the entire atmosphere. &quot;Aerosol&quot; means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets). &quot;atmosphere_optical_thickness_due_to_water_in_ambient_aerosol&quot; refers to the optical thickness due to the water that is associated with aerosol particles due to hygroscopic growth in ambient air, affecting the particle&#39;s radius and refractive index.  It corresponds to the difference between the total dry aerosol optical thickness and the total ambient aerosol optical thickness.</description>

      <amip></amip>
      <description>&quot;change_over_time_in_X&quot; means change in a quantity X over a time-interval, which should be defined by the bounds of the time coordinate. Absolute Salinity, S_A, is defined as part of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) which was adopted in 2010 by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). It is the mass fraction of dissolved material in sea water. Absolute Salinity incorporates the spatial variations in the composition of sea water. This type of Absolute Salinity is also called &quot;Density Salinity&quot;. TEOS-10 estimates Absolute Salinity as the salinity variable that, when used with the TEOS-10 expression for density, yields the correct density of a sea water sample even when the sample is not of Reference Composition. In practice, Absolute Salinity is often calculated from Practical Salinity using a spatial lookup table of pre-defined values of the Absolute Salinity Anomaly. It is recommended that the version of (TEOS-10) software and the associated Absolute Salinity Anomaly climatology be specified within metadata by attaching a comment attribute to the data variable. Reference: www.teos-10.org; Millero et al., 2008 doi: 10.1016/j.dsr.2007.10.001. There are also standard names for the precisely defined salinity quantities sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between 1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P (used for salinity observations from 1978 onwards), sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity. Salinity quantities that do not match any of the precise definitions should be given the more general standard name of sea_water_salinity.</description>

      <description>&quot;change_over_time_in_X&quot; means change in a quantity X over a time-interval, which should be defined by the bounds of the time coordinate. Conservative Temperature is defined as part of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) which was adopted in 2010 by the International Oceanographic Commission (IOC). Conservative Temperature is specific potential enthalpy (which has the standard name sea_water_specific_potential_enthalpy) divided by a fixed value of the specific heat capacity of sea water, namely cp_0 = 3991.86795711963 J kg-1 K-1. Conservative Temperature is a more accurate measure of the &quot;heat content&quot; of sea water, by a factor of one hundred, than is potential temperature. Because of this, it can be regarded as being proportional to the heat content of sea water per unit mass.

      <description>&quot;change_over_time_in_X&quot; means change in a quantity X over a time-interval, which should be defined by the bounds of the time coordinate. &quot;Neutral density&quot; is a variable designed so that a surface of constant neutral density everywhere has a local slope that is close to the local slope of the neutral tangent plane. At the sea surface in the equatorial Pacific neutral density is very close to the potential density anomaly. At other locations, this is not the case. For example, along a neutral density surface there is a difference of up to 0.14 kg/m^3 in the potential density anomaly at the outcrops in the Southern and Northern hemispheres.

      <description>&quot;change_over_time_in_X&quot; means change in a quantity X over a time-interval, which should be defined by the bounds of the time coordinate. Practical Salinity, S_P, is defined on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78) and is calculated from the electrical conductivity of sea water (as well as temperature and pressure).  Officially S_P is dimensionless so that, while convenient, and while it is common practice, it is not officially sanctioned to say S_P = 35 psu. Often authors use PSS-78, as in S_P = 35 PSS-78. If salinity was measured using remote sensing techniques and not conductivity, then it is recommended that additional metadata (calibration/validation information) be described in the variable comment attribute. This name should be used to describe salinity observations made from 1978 onwards (Practical Salinity is the salinity quantity stored by national data centres for post-1978 observations). The only exception to this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale.  There are also standard names for the precisely defined salinity quantities sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between 1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity. Salinity quantities that do not match any of the precise definitions should be given the more general standard name of sea_water_salinity.

      <description>&quot;change_over_time_in_X&quot; means change in a quantity X over a time-interval, which should be defined by the bounds of the time coordinate. Preformed Salinity, S*, is defined as part of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) which was adopted in 2010 by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). Preformed Salinity is a salinity variable that is designed to be as conservative as possible, by removing the estimated biogeochemical influences on the sea water composition. Preformed Salinity is Absolute Salinity, S_A (which has the standard name sea_water_absolute_salinity), minus all contributions to sea water composition from biogeochemical processes. Preformed Salinity is the mass fraction of dissolved material in sea water.

      <description>&quot;change_over_time_in_X&quot; means change in a quantity X over a time-interval, which should be defined by the bounds of the time coordinate. Sea water salinity is the salt content of sea water, often on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978. However, the unqualified term &#39;salinity&#39; is generic and does not necessarily imply any particular method of calculation. The units of salinity are dimensionless and the units attribute should normally be given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. There are standard names for the more precisely defined salinity quantities: sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between 1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P (used for salinity observations from 1978 to the present day), sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity. Practical Salinity is reported on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78), and is usually based on the electrical conductivity of sea water in observations since the 1960s. Conversion of data between the observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P = S_C, however the accuracy of the latter is dependent on whether chlorinity or conductivity was used to determine the S_C value, with this inconsistency driving the development of PSS-78. The more precise standard names should be used where appropriate for both modelled and observed salinities. In particular, the use of sea_water_salinity to describe salinity observations made from 1978 onwards is now deprecated in favor of the term sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity quantity stored by national data centers for post-1978 observations. The only exception to this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit &quot;parts per thousand&quot; was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and sea_water_cox_salinity.</description>

      <description>&quot;change_over_time_in_X&quot; means change in a quantity X over a time-interval, which should be defined by the bounds of the time coordinate.Sea water temperature is the in situ temperature of the sea water. To specify the depth at which the temperature applies use a vertical coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable. There are standard names for sea_surface_temperature, sea_surface_skin_temperature, sea_surface_subskin_temperature and sea_surface_foundation_temperature which can be used to describe data located at the specified surfaces. For observed data, depending on the period during which the observation was made, the measured in situ temperature was recorded against standard &quot;scales&quot;. These historical scales include the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1948 (IPTS-48; 1948-1967), the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68, Barber, 1969; 1968-1989) and the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90, Saunders 1990; 1990 onwards). Conversion of data between these scales follows t68 = t48 - (4.4 x 10e-6) * t48(100 - t - 48); t90 = 0.99976 * t68. Observations made prior to 1948 (IPTS-48) have not been documented and therefore a conversion cannot be certain. Differences between t90 and t68 can be up to 0.01 at temperatures of 40 C and above; differences of 0.002-0.007 occur across the standard range of ocean temperatures (-10 - 30 C). The International Equation of State of Seawater 1980 (EOS-80, UNESCO, 1981) and the Practical Salinity Scale (PSS-78) were both based on IPTS-68, while the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) is based on ITS-90.

      <description>This quantity, sometimes called the &quot;isotherm depth&quot;, is the depth (if it exists) at which the sea water potential temperature equals some specified value. This value should be specified in a scalar coordinate variable. Depth is the vertical distance below the surface. Potential temperature is the temperature a parcel of air or sea water would have if moved adiabatically to sea level pressure.</description>

      <description>&quot;direction_of_X&quot; means direction of a  vector, a bearing.  &quot;Displacement&quot; means the change in geospatial position of an object that has moved over time. If possible, the time interval over which the motion took place should be specified using a bounds variable for the time coordinate variable.  A displacement can be represented as a vector. Such a vector should however not be interpreted as describing a rectilinear, constant speed motion but merely as an indication that the start point of the vector is found at the tip of the vector after the time interval associated with the displacement variable.  A displacement does not prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component. In that case, &quot;displacement&quot; is also the distance across the earth&#39;s surface calculated from the change in a moving object&#39;s geospatial position between the start and end of the time interval associated with the displacement variable. The &quot;direction of displacement&quot; is the angle between due north and the displacement vector.</description>

The direction from which it is coming must be specified, for instance with a coordinate of zenith_angle. If the radiation does not depend on direction, a standard name of isotropic radiance should be chosen instead. &quot;Photosynthetic&quot; radiation is the part of the spectrum which is used in photosynthesis e.g. 300-700 nm. The range of wavelengths could be specified precisely by the bounds of a coordinate of radiation_wavelength.</description>

If possible, the time interval over which the motion took place should be specified using a bounds variable for the time coordinate variable.  A displacement can be represented as a vector. Such a vector should however not be interpreted as describing a rectilinear, constant speed motion but merely as an indication that the start point of the vector is found at the tip of the vector after the time interval associated with the displacement variable.  A displacement does not prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component. An eastward displacement is the distance calculated from the change in a moving object&#39;s longitude between the start and end of the time interval associated with the displacement variable.</description>

If the layers are model layers, the vertical coordinate can be model_level_number, but it is recommended to specify a physical coordinate (in a scalar or auxiliary coordinate variable) as well. Depth is the vertical distance below the surface. Sea water temperature is the in situ temperature of the sea water. For observed data, depending on the period during which the observation was made, the measured in situ temperature was recorded against standard &quot;scales&quot;. These historical scales include the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1948 (IPTS-48; 1948-1967), the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68, Barber, 1969; 1968-1989) and the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90, Saunders 1990; 1990 onwards). Conversion of data between these scales follows t68 = t48 - (4.4 x 10e-6) * t48(100 - t - 48); t90 = 0.99976 * t68. Observations made prior to 1948 (IPTS-48) have not been documented and therefore a conversion cannot be certain. Differences between t90 and t68 can be up to 0.01 at temperatures of 40 C and above; differences of 0.002-0.007 occur across the standard range of ocean temperatures (-10 - 30 C). The International Equation of State of Seawater 1980 (EOS-80, UNESCO, 1981) and the Practical Salinity Scale (PSS-78) were both based on IPTS-68, while the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) is based on ITS-90.

If possible, the time interval over which the motion took place should be specified using a bounds variable for the time coordinate variable.  A displacement can be represented as a vector. Such a vector should however not be interpreted as describing a rectilinear, constant speed motion but merely as an indication that the start point of the vector is found at the tip of the vector after the time interval associated with the displacement variable.  A displacement does not prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component.</description>

A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &#39;nitrogen&#39; or a phrase such as &#39;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&#39;. Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons, i.e. they do not contain any chemical double bonds.  Alkanes contain only hydrogen and carbon combined in the general proportions C(n)H(2n+2); &quot;alkanes&quot; is the term used in standard names to describe the group of chemical species having this common structure that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models.  Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. Standard names exist for some individual alkane species, e.g., methane and ethane.</description>

      <description>&#39;Mass concentration&#39; means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.  A chemical or biological species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &#39;nitrogen&#39; or a phrase such as &#39;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&#39;. Chlorophylls are the green pigments found in most plants, algae and cyanobacteria; their presence is essential for photosynthesis to take place. There are several different forms of chlorophyll that occur naturally. All contain a chlorin ring (chemical formula C20H16N4) which gives the green pigment and a side chain whose structure varies. The naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain between 35 and 55 carbon atoms. Chlorophyll-a is the most commonly occurring form of natural chlorophyll. The chemical formula of chlorophyll-a is C55H72O5N4Mg.</description>

      <description>Mass concentration means mass per unit volume and is used in the construction mass_concentration_of_X_in_Y, where X is a material constituent of Y.  A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as &#39;nitrogen&#39; or a phrase such as &#39;nox_expressed_as_nitrogen&#39;. &quot;Clox&quot; describes a family of chemical species consisting of inorganic chlorine compounds with the exception of  hydrogen chloride (HCl) and chlorine nitrate (ClONO2). &quot;Clox&quot; is the term used in standard names for all species belonging to the family that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity with a group chemical standard name can vary between models.  Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. &quot;Inorganic chlorine&quot;, sometimes referred to as Cly, describes a family of chemical species which result from the degradation of source gases containing chlorine (CFCs, HCFCs, VSLS) and natural inorganic chlorine sources such as seasalt and other aerosols.   Standard names that use the term &quot;inorganic_chlorine&quot; are used for quantities that contain all inorganic chlorine species including HCl and ClONO2. The phrase &#39;expressed_as&#39; is used in the construction A_expressed_as_B, where B is a chemical constituent of A. It means that the quantity indicated by the standard name is calculated solely with respect to the B contained in A, neglecting all other chemical constituents of A.</description>

Standard names also exist for the mass concentration of a number of components that make up the total phytoplankton population, such as diatoms, diazotrophs, calcareous phytoplankton, picophytoplankton and miscellaneous phytoplankton. Chlorophylls are the green pigments found in most plants, algae and cyanobacteria; their presence is essential for photosynthesis to take place. There are several different forms of chlorophyll that occur naturally. All contain a chlorin ring (chemical formula C20H16N4) which gives the green pigment and a side chain whose structure varies. The naturally occurring forms of chlorophyll contain between 35 and 55 carbon atoms. </description>

      <description>&quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;content_of_X_in_atmosphere_layer&quot; refers to the vertical integral between two specified levels in the atmosphere. &quot;Layer&quot; means any layer with upper and lower boundaries that have constant values in some vertical coordinate. There must be a vertical coordinate variable indicating the extent of the layer(s). If the layers are model layers, the vertical coordinate can be model_level_number, but it is recommended to specify a physical coordinate (in a scalar or auxiliary coordinate variable) as well. For the mole content integrated from the surface to the top of the atmosphere, standard names including &quot;atmosphere_mole_content_of_X&quot; are used. The chemical formula for ozone is O3. &quot;mole_content_of_ozone_in_atmosphere_layer&quot; is usually measured in Dobson Units which are equivalent to 446.2 micromoles m-2. N.B. Data variables containing column content of ozone can be given the standard name of either equivalent_thickness_at_stp_of_atmosphere_ozone_content or atmosphere_mole_content_of_ozone. The latter name is recommended for consistency with mole content names for chemical species other than ozone.</description>

      <description>&quot;Normalized_difference_vegetation_index&quot;, usually abbreviated to NDVI, is an index calculated from reflectances measured in the visible and near infrared channels.  It is calculated as NDVI = (NIR - R) / (NIR + R) where NIR is the reflectance in the near-infrared band and R is the reflectance in the red visible band.  Reflectance is the ratio of the reflected over the incoming radiation in each spectral band.  The calculated value of NDVI depends on the precise definitions of the spectral bands and these definitions may vary between different models and remote sensing instruments.</description>

      <description>&quot;Northward&quot; indicates a vector component which is positive when directed northward (negative southward).  &quot;Displacement&quot; means the change in geospatial position of an object that has moved over time. If possible, the time interval over which the motion took place should be specified using a bounds variable for the time coordinate variable.  A displacement can be represented as a vector. Such a vector should however not be interpreted as describing a rectilinear, constant speed motion but merely as an indication that the start point of the vector is found at the tip of the vector after the time interval associated with the displacement variable.  A displacement does not prescribe a trajectory. Sea ice displacement can be defined as a two-dimensional vector, with no vertical component. A northward displacement is the distance calculated from the change in a moving object&#39;s latitude between the start and end of the time interval associated with the displacement variable.</description>

      <description>&quot;integral_of_Y_wrt_X&quot; means int Y dX. The data variable should have an axis for X specifying the limits of the integral as bounds. &quot;wrt&quot; means with respect to. Depth is the vertical distance below the surface. Sea water temperature is the in situ temperature of the sea water. For observed data, depending on the period during which the observation was made, the measured in situ temperature was recorded against standard &quot;scales&quot;. These historical scales include the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1948 (IPTS-48; 1948-1967), the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68, Barber, 1969; 1968-1989) and the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90, Saunders 1990; 1990 onwards). Conversion of data between these scales follows t68 = t48 - (4.4 x 10e-6) * t48(100 - t - 48); t90 = 0.99976 * t68. Observations made prior to 1948 (IPTS-48) have not been documented and therefore a conversion cannot be certain. Differences between t90 and t68 can be up to 0.01 at temperatures of 40 C and above; differences of 0.002-0.007 occur across the standard range of ocean temperatures (-10 - 30 C). The International Equation of State of Seawater 1980 (EOS-80, UNESCO, 1981) and the Practical Salinity Scale (PSS-78) were both based on IPTS-68, while the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) is based on ITS-90.

If the layers are model layers, the vertical coordinate can be model_level_number, but it is recommended to specify a physical coordinate (in a scalar or auxiliary coordinate variable) as well.  The optical thickness is the integral along the path of radiation of a volume scattering/absorption/attenuation coefficient. The radiative flux is reduced by a factor exp(-optical_thickness) on traversing the path.  A coordinate variable of radiation_wavelength or radiation_frequency can be specified to indicate that the optical thickness applies at specific wavelengths or frequencies. &quot;Aerosol&quot; means the suspended liquid or solid particles in air (except cloud droplets).  &quot;Ambient aerosol&quot; is aerosol that has taken up ambient water through hygroscopic growth. The extent of hygroscopic growth depends on the relative humidity and the composition of the aerosol.

It differs from the change in the global average sea surface height relative to the centre of the Earth by the global average vertical movement of the ocean floor. Zero sea level change is an arbitrary level. Phase is the initial angle of a wave modelled by a sinusoidal function. A coordinate variable of harmonic_period can be used to specify the period of the sinusoidal wave.</description>

There are standard names for the more precisely defined salinity quantities: sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between 1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P (used for salinity observations from 1978 to the present day), sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity. Practical Salinity is reported on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78), and is usually based on the electrical conductivity of sea water in observations since the 1960s. Conversion of data between the observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P = S_C, however the accuracy of the latter is dependent on whether chlorinity or conductivity was used to determine the S_C value, with this inconsistency driving the development of PSS-78. The more precise standard names should be used where appropriate for both modelled and observed salinities. In particular, the use of sea_water_salinity to describe salinity observations made from 1978 onwards is now deprecated in favor of the term sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity quantity stored by national data centers for post-1978 observations. The only exception to this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit &quot;parts per thousand&quot; was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and sea_water_cox_salinity.</description>

      <description>The geoid is a surface of constant geopotential with which mean sea level would coincide if the ocean were at rest. (The volume enclosed between the geoid and the sea floor equals the mean volume of water in the ocean.) In an ocean GCM the geoid is the surface of zero depth, or the rigid lid if the model uses that approximation. &quot;Sea surface height&quot; is a time-varying quantity. By definition of the geoid, the global average of the time-mean sea surface height (i.e. mean sea level) above the geoid must be zero. The standard name for the height of the sea surface above mean sea level is sea_surface_height_above_sea_level.

      <description>The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. The sea surface foundation temperature is the water temperature that is not influenced by a thermally stratified layer of diurnal temperature variability (either by daytime warming or nocturnal cooling). The foundation temperature is named to indicate that it is the temperature from which the growth of the diurnal thermocline develops each day, noting that on some occasions with a deep mixed layer there is no clear foundation temperature in the surface layer. In general, sea surface foundation temperature will be similar to a night time minimum or pre-dawn value at depths of between approximately 1 and 5 meters. In the absence of any diurnal signal, the foundation temperature is considered equivalent to the quantity with standard name sea_surface_subskin_temperature. The sea surface foundation temperature defines a level in the upper water column that varies in depth, space, and time depending on the local balance between thermal stratification and turbulent energy and is expected to change slowly over the course of a day. If possible, a data variable with the standard name sea_surface_foundation_temperature should be used with a scalar vertical coordinate variable to specify the depth of the foundation level. Sea surface foundation temperature is measured at the base of the diurnal thermocline or as close to the water surface as possible in the absence of thermal stratification. Only in situ contact thermometry is able to measure the sea surface foundation temperature. Analysis procedures must be used to estimate sea surface foundation temperature value from radiometric satellite measurements of the quantities with standard names sea_surface_skin_temperature and sea_surface_subskin_temperature.  Sea surface foundation temperature provides a connection with the historical concept of a &quot;bulk&quot; sea surface temperature considered representative of the oceanic mixed layer temperature that is typically represented by any sea temperature measurement within the upper ocean over a depth range of 1 to approximately 20 meters. The general term, &quot;bulk&quot; sea surface temperature, has the standard name sea_surface_temperature with no associated vertical coordinate axis. Sea surface foundation temperature provides a more precise, well-defined quantity than &quot;bulk&quot; sea surface temperature and, consequently, is more representative of the mixed layer temperature.  The temperature of sea water at a particular depth (other than the foundation level) should be reported using the standard name sea_water_temperature and, wherever possible, supplying a vertical coordinate axis or scalar coordinate variable.</description>

      <description>Sea surface salinity is the salt content of sea water close to the sea surface, often on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978. However, the unqualified term &#39;salinity&#39; is generic and does not necessarily imply any particular method of calculation. The units of salinity are dimensionless and the units attribute should normally be given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. Sea surface salinity is often abbreviated as &quot;SSS&quot;. For the salinity of sea water at a particular depth or layer, a data variable of &quot;sea_water_salinity&quot; or one of the more precisely defined salinities should be used with a vertical coordinate axis. There are standard names for the precisely defined salinity quantities: sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between 1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P (used for salinity observations from 1978 to the present day), sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity. Practical Salinity is reported on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78), and is usually based on the electrical conductivity of sea water in observations since the 1960s. Conversion of data between the observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P = S_C, however the accuracy of the latter is dependent on whether chlorinity or conductivity was used to determine the S_C value, with this inconsistency driving the development of PSS-78. The more precise standard names should be used where appropriate for both modelled and observed salinities. In particular, the use of sea_water_salinity to describe salinity observations made from 1978 onwards is now deprecated in favor of the term sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity quantity stored by national data centers for post-1978 observations. The only exception to this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit &quot;parts per thousand&quot; was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and sea_water_cox_salinity.</description>

      <description>The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. The sea surface skin temperature is the temperature measured by an infrared radiometer typically operating at wavelengths in the range 3.7 - 12 micrometers. It represents the temperature within the conductive diffusion-dominated sub-layer at a depth of approximately 10 - 20 micrometers below the air-sea interface. Measurements of this quantity are subject to a large potential diurnal cycle including cool skin layer effects (especially at night under clear skies and low wind speed conditions) and warm layer effects in the daytime.</description>

      <description>The surface called &quot;surface&quot; means the lower boundary of the atmosphere. The sea surface subskin temperature is the temperature at the base of the conductive laminar sub-layer of the ocean surface, that is, at a depth of approximately 1 - 1.5 millimeters below the air-sea interface. For practical purposes, this quantity can be well approximated to the measurement of surface temperature by a microwave radiometer operating in the 6 - 11 gigahertz frequency range, but the relationship is neither direct nor invariant to changing physical conditions or to the specific geometry of the microwave measurements. Measurements of this quantity are subject to a large potential diurnal cycle due to thermal stratification of the upper ocean layer in low wind speed high solar irradiance conditions.</description>

      <description>Absolute Salinity, S_A, is defined as part of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) which was adopted in 2010 by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). It is the mass fraction of dissolved material in sea water. Absolute Salinity incorporates the spatial variations in the composition of sea water. This type of Absolute Salinity is also called &quot;Density Salinity&quot;. TEOS-10 estimates Absolute Salinity as the salinity variable that, when used with the TEOS-10 expression for density, yields the correct density of a sea water sample even when the sample is not of Reference Composition. In practice, Absolute Salinity is often calculated from Practical Salinity using a spatial lookup table of pre-defined values of the Absolute Salinity Anomaly. It is recommended that the version of (TEOS-10) software and the associated Absolute Salinity Anomaly climatology be specified within metadata by attaching a comment attribute to the data variable.

      <description>Conservative Temperature is defined as part of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) which was adopted in 2010 by the International Oceanographic Commission (IOC). Conservative Temperature is specific potential enthalpy (which has the standard name sea_water_specific_potential_enthalpy) divided by a fixed value of the specific heat capacity of sea water, namely cp_0 = 3991.86795711963 J kg-1 K-1. Conservative Temperature is a more accurate measure of the &quot;heat content&quot; of sea water, by a factor of one hundred, than is potential temperature. Because of this, it can be regarded as being proportional to the heat content of sea water per unit mass.

      <description>Cox Salinity, S_C, is defined unitless as a mass fraction per mil (0/00) or &quot;parts per thousand&quot;. S_C was the standard salinity measure from 1967 until Practical Salinity, S_P, was established with PSS-78 (1978). Chlorinity, Cl, is calculated from the conductivity of a sea water sample and since the work of the Joint Panel for Oceanographic Tables and Standards (JPOTS; 1966) is converted into Cox Salinity using S_C = 1.80655Cl. This type of salinity was called simply &quot;salinity&quot; from 1967 to 1978. Cox Salinity was replaced by Practical Salinity in 1978. Cox Salinity is converted to Practical Salinity following S_P = S_C, however the accuracy of this is dependent on whether chlorinity or conductivity was used to determine the S_C value, with this inconsistency driving the development of the Practical Salinity Scale 1978 (PSS-78).

      <description>Knudsen Salinity, S_K, is defined unitless as a mass fraction per mil (0/00) or &quot;parts per thousand&quot;, and was calculated from the titration of inorganic salts from a sample of sea water after a commission to study the problem of determining salinity and density was initiated by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) in 1899. S_K was the standard salinity measure until S_C (Cox Salinity) was established in 1967. Since the work of Knudsen (1901), chlorinity is converted into Knudsen Salinity using S_K = 0.030 + 1.805 Cl. This type of salinity was called simply &quot;salinity&quot; from 1901 to 1966. From the 1960s on, electrical conductivity began to be used to estimate the Knudsen Salinity, rather than chemical titration. Knudsen Salinity was replaced by Cox Salinity in 1967 which was in turn replaced by Practical Salinity, S_P, in 1978. Conversion of Knudsen Salinity to Practical Salinity follows S_P = (S_K - 0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805).

      <description>&quot;Neutral density&quot; is a variable designed so that a surface of constant neutral density everywhere has a local slope that is close to the local slope of the neutral tangent plane. At the sea surface in the equatorial Pacific neutral density is very close to the potential density anomaly. At other locations, this is not the case. For example, along a neutral density surface there is a difference of up to 0.14 kg/m^3 in the potential density anomaly at the outcrops in the Southern and Northern hemispheres.

      <description>Practical Salinity, S_P, is defined on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78) and is calculated from the electrical conductivity of sea water (as well as temperature and pressure).  Officially S_P is dimensionless so that, while convenient, and while it is common practice, it is not officially sanctioned to say S_P = 35 psu. Often authors use PSS-78, as in S_P = 35 PSS-78. If salinity was measured using remote sensing techniques and not conductivity, then it is recommended that additional metadata (calibration/validation information) be described in the variable comment attribute. This name should be used to describe salinity observations made from 1978 onwards (Practical Salinity is the salinity quantity stored by national data centres for post-1978 observations). The only exception to this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale.  There are also standard names for the precisely defined salinity quantities sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between 1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity. Salinity quantities that do not match any of the precise definitions should be given the more general standard name of sea_water_salinity.

      <description>Preformed Salinity, S*, is defined as part of the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) which was adopted in 2010 by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC). Preformed Salinity is a salinity variable that is designed to be as conservative as possible, by removing the estimated biogeochemical influences on the sea water composition. Preformed Salinity is Absolute Salinity, S_A (which has the standard name sea_water_absolute_salinity), minus all contributions to sea water composition from biogeochemical processes. Preformed Salinity is the mass fraction of dissolved material in sea water.

      <description>Sea water salinity is the salt content of sea water, often on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978. However, the unqualified term &#39;salinity&#39; is generic and does not necessarily imply any particular method of calculation. The units of salinity are dimensionless and the units attribute should normally be given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. There are standard names for the more precisely defined salinity quantities: sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between 1901 and 1966),  sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P (used for salinity observations from 1978 to the present day), sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity. Practical Salinity is reported on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78), and is usually based on the electrical conductivity of sea water in observations since the 1960s. Conversion of data between the observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P = S_C, however the accuracy of the latter is dependent on whether chlorinity or conductivity was used to determine the S_C value, with this inconsistency driving the development of PSS-78. The more precise standard names should be used where appropriate for both modelled and observed salinities. In particular, the use of sea_water_salinity to describe salinity observations made from 1978 onwards is now deprecated in favor of the term sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity quantity stored by national data centers for post-1978 observations. The only exception to this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit &quot;parts per thousand&quot; was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and sea_water_cox_salinity.</description>

      <description>Sea water temperature is the in situ temperature of the sea water. To specify the depth at which the temperature applies use a vertical coordinate variable or scalar coordinate variable. There are standard names for sea_surface_temperature, sea_surface_skin_temperature, sea_surface_subskin_temperature and sea_surface_foundation_temperature which can be used to describe data located at the specified surfaces. For observed data, depending on the period during which the observation was made, the measured in situ temperature was recorded against standard &quot;scales&quot;. These historical scales include the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1948 (IPTS-48; 1948-1967), the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68, Barber, 1969; 1968-1989) and the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90, Saunders 1990; 1990 onwards). Conversion of data between these scales follows t68 = t48 - (4.4 x 10e-6) * t48(100 - t - 48); t90 = 0.99976 * t68. Observations made prior to 1948 (IPTS-48) have not been documented and therefore a conversion cannot be certain. Differences between t90 and t68 can be up to 0.01 at temperatures of 40 C and above; differences of 0.002-0.007 occur across the standard range of ocean temperatures (-10 - 30 C). The International Equation of State of Seawater 1980 (EOS-80, UNESCO, 1981) and the Practical Salinity Scale (PSS-78) were both based on IPTS-68, while the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) is based on ITS-90.

The &quot;soil content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface down to the bottom of the soil model. For the content between specified levels in the soil, standard names including content_of_soil_layer are used.  &quot;Soil carbon&quot; is the organic matter present in soil quantified by the mass of carbon it contains. Soil carbon is returned to the atmosphere as the organic matter decays. The decay process takes varying amounts of time depending on the composition of the organic matter, the temperature and the availability of moisture. A carbon &quot;soil pool&quot; means the carbon contained in organic matter which has a characteristic period over which it decays and releases carbon into the atmosphere. &quot;Slow soil pool&quot; refers to the decay of organic matter in soil with a characteristic period of more than a hundred years under reference climate conditions of a temperature of 20 degrees Celsius and no water limitations.</description>

      <description>This quantity is defined as the temperature difference between a parcel of air lifted adiabatically from a starting air pressure to a finishing air pressure in the troposphere and the ambient air temperature at the finishing air pressure in the troposphere. It is often called the lifted index (LI) and provides a measure of the instability of the atmosphere. The air parcel is &quot;lifted&quot; by moving the air parcel from the starting air pressure to the Lifting Condensation Level (dry adiabatically) and then from the Lifting Condensation Level to the finishing air pressure (wet adiabatically). Air temperature is the bulk temperature of the air. Coordinate variables of original_air_pressure_of_lifted_parcel and final_air_pressure_of_lifted_parcel should be specified to indicate the specific air pressures at which the parcel lifting starts (starting air pressure) and the temperature difference is calculated at (finishing air pressure), respectively.</description>

      <description>&quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. &quot;Content&quot; indicates a quantity per unit area. The &quot;atmosphere content&quot; of a quantity refers to the vertical integral from the surface to the top of the atmosphere. For the content between specified levels in the atmosphere, standard names including &quot;content_of_atmosphere_layer&quot; are used. The mass is the total mass of the molecules. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. &quot;Emission&quot; means emission from a primary source located anywhere within the atmosphere, including at the lower boundary (i.e. earth&#39;s surface). &quot;Emission&quot; is a process entirely distinct from &quot;re-emission&quot; which is used in some standard names. An organic acid is an organic compound with acidic properties. The most common organic acids are the carboxylic acids, whose acidity is associated with their carboxyl group -COOH. In standard names &quot;organic_acids&quot; is the term used to describe the group of organic acid species that are represented within a given model. The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible, the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented, for example, by using a comment attribute. The &quot;residential and commercial combustion&quot; sector comprises fuel combustion activities related to the commercial/institutional sector, the residential sector and the agriculture/forestry/fishing sector. It may also include any not-classified or &quot;other&quot; combustion, which is commonly included in the inventory data. &quot;Residential and commercial combustion&quot; is the term used in standard names to describe a collection of emission sources. A variable which has this value for the standard_name attribute should be accompanied by a comment attribute which lists the source categories and provides a reference to the categorization scheme, for example, &quot;IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source categories 1A4a, 1A4b and 1A4c as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories&quot;.</description>

The &quot;aviation&quot; sector includes fuel combustion activities related to civil aviation. &quot;Aviation&quot; is the term used in standard names to describe a collection of emission sources. A variable which has this value for the standard_name attribute should be accompanied by a comment attribute which lists the source categories and provides a reference to the categorization scheme, for example, &quot;IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) source category 1A3a as defined in the 2006 IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories&quot;.</description>

However, the unqualified term &#39;salinity&#39; is generic and does not necessarily imply any particular method of calculation. The units of salinity are dimensionless and normally given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. There are standard names for the more precisely defined salinity quantities: sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between 1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P (used for salinity observations from 1978 to the present day), sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity. Practical Salinity is reported on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78), and is usually based on the electrical conductivity of sea water in observations since the 1960s. Conversion of data between the observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P = S_C, however the accuracy of the latter is dependent on whether chlorinity or conductivity was used to determine the S_C value, with this inconsistency driving the development of PSS-78. The more precise standard names should be used where appropriate for both modelled and observed salinities. In particular, the use of sea_water_salinity to describe salinity observations made from 1978 onwards is now deprecated in favor of the term sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity quantity stored by national data centers for post-1978 observations. The only exception to this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale.

However, the unqualified term &#39;salinity&#39; is generic and does not necessarily imply any particular method of calculation. The units of salinity are dimensionless and normally given as 1e-3 or 0.001 i.e. parts per thousand. There are standard names for the more precisely defined salinity quantities: sea_water_knudsen_salinity, S_K (used for salinity observations between 1901 and 1966), sea_water_cox_salinity, S_C (used for salinity observations between 1967 and 1977), sea_water_practical_salinity, S_P (used for salinity observations from 1978 to the present day), sea_water_absolute_salinity, S_A, sea_water_preformed_salinity, S_*, and sea_water_reference_salinity. Practical Salinity is reported on the Practical Salinity Scale of 1978 (PSS-78), and is usually based on the electrical conductivity of sea water in observations since the 1960s. Conversion of data between the observed scales follows: S_P = (S_K - 0.03) * (1.80655 / 1.805) and S_P = S_C, however the accuracy of the latter is dependent on whether chlorinity or conductivity was used to determine the S_C value, with this inconsistency driving the development of PSS-78. The more precise standard names should be used where appropriate for both modelled and observed salinities. In particular, the use of sea_water_salinity to describe salinity observations made from 1978 onwards is now deprecated in favor of the term sea_water_practical_salinity which is the salinity quantity stored by national data centers for post-1978 observations. The only exception to this is where the observed salinities are definitely known not to be recorded on the Practical Salinity Scale. The unit &quot;parts per thousand&quot; was used for sea_water_knudsen_salinity and sea_water_cox_salinity.</description>

      <description>&quot;tendency_of_X&quot; means derivative of X with respect to time. Sea water temperature is the in situ temperature of the sea water. For observed data, depending on the period during which the observation was made, the measured in situ temperature was recorded against standard &quot;scales&quot;. These historical scales include the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1948 (IPTS-48; 1948-1967), the International Practical Temperature Scale of 1968 (IPTS-68, Barber, 1969; 1968-1989) and the International Temperature Scale of 1990 (ITS-90, Saunders 1990; 1990 onwards). Conversion of data between these scales follows t68 = t48 - (4.4 x 10e-6) * t48(100 - t - 48); t90 = 0.99976 * t68. Observations made prior to 1948 (IPTS-48) have not been documented and therefore a conversion cannot be certain. Differences between t90 and t68 can be up to 0.01 at temperatures of 40 C and above; differences of 0.002-0.007 occur across the standard range of ocean temperatures (-10 - 30 C). The International Equation of State of Seawater 1980 (EOS-80, UNESCO, 1981) and the Practical Salinity Scale (PSS-78) were both based on IPTS-68, while the Thermodynamic Equation of Seawater 2010 (TEOS-10) is based on ITS-90.

      <description>toa_brightness_temperature_bias_at_standard_scene_due_to_intercalibration is the difference between top-of-atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperature
of the reference sensor and TOA brightness temperature of the
monitored sensor. This TOA brightness temperature difference is a measure of the calibration difference between the monitored and reference sensors. The standard scene is a target area with typical Earth surface and atmospheric conditions that is accepted as a reference. Brightness temperature of a body is the temperature of a black body which radiates the same power per unit solid angle per unit area at a given wavenumber. TOA brightness temperature of the standard scene is calculated using a radiative transfer simulation for a given viewing geometry. The resultant top-of-atmosphere spectral radiance is then integrated with each sensor&#39;s spectral response function and converted to equivalent brightness temperature. The specification of a physical process by the phrase &quot;due_to_&quot; process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase.</description>

      <description>toa_outgoing_radiance_per_unit_wavenumber_stdev_within_collocation_scene is the standard deviation of observations of the quantity with standard name toa_outgoing_radiance_per_unit_wavenumber from a sensor&#39;s adjacent field-of-views within a collocation scene. &quot;toa&quot; means top of atmosphere. The TOA outgoing radiance is the upwelling radiance, i.e., toward outer space. Radiance is the radiative flux in a particular direction, per unit of solid angle. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics. The &quot;collocation scene&quot; is a grouping of a sensor&#39;s adjacent field-of-views centered on a collocation target. The size of the collocation scene is typically about twice that of the collocation target. The &quot;collocation target&quot; is an area on the Earth&#39;s surface at which observations from at least two sensors are collected. Its size is defined by the sensor with the largest field-of-view footprint. Two events are deemed to be collocated based on some set of spatial, temporal, and viewing geometry criteria.</description>

      <description>&quot;x&quot; indicates a vector component along the grid x-axis, positive with increasing x. The specification of a physical process by the phrase due_to_process means that the quantity named is a single term in a sum of terms which together compose the general quantity named by omitting the phrase. In accordance with common usage in geophysical disciplines, &quot;flux&quot; implies per unit area, called &quot;flux density&quot; in physics.</description>
