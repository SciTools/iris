# NOTE: based on a generic template in Scitools/.github/templates/MANIFEST.in

# General principles
#     - enable user to build locally, as well as in CI
#     - make it ignore temporary files generated by dev processes, e.g. coverage checks
#     - encode typical decisions, e.g. whether we package docs, requirements etc

#---------
# SECTION: main code sources
# N.B. package dir is "lib" not "src"
recursive-include lib *.cdl *.cml *.json *.md *.py *.template *.txt *.xml
    # principles:
    #    - *no* "prune" command is used
    #    - use "include-recursive", by relevant file extensions
    # hints:
    #     - top-level dir is typically "src", but maybe "lib" or <package-name>
    #     - default package rules mean we generally don't actually *need* a statement
    #         - but it's better to be explicit
    #     - extension filetypes are typically sources (*.py)
    #         - might also need testdata files, e.g. *.nc, *.npy *.npz
    #         - also possibly non-python, e.g. *.pyx for Cython


#---------
# SECTION: requirements
prune requirements
recursive-include requirements *.txt
    # principles:
    #    include just requirements-level info, not lock files
    # hints:
    #    - not all projects include requirements, but they can be drawn in anyway by dynamic dependencies
    #        in the setuptools build process, linked via config in pyproject.toml


#---------
# SECTION: root files
exclude .flake8
exclude .git-blame-ignore-revs
exclude .git_archival.txt

exclude pixi.lock
    # principles:
    #    - *ANY* file in the root should be explicitly "include"- or "exclude"-d
    #         - EXCEPT (possibly) those covered by setuptools default rules (see above link)
    #             - including : README.md/.rst; pyproject.toml; setup.py/.cfg
    #         - N.B. a GHA "ci-manifest" check, if used, will check all this
    #    - the above are typical ones : given in sorted order
    #    - NB many will (eventually) be templated, but that is a separate issue
    #    - probably, this section can be included as *boilerplate*
    #        - i.e. it doesn't matter if some of the files mentioned don't exist


#---------
# SECTION: generic exclusions
# (1) top-level directories to omit entirely
prune .github
prune .nox
prune .tox
prune .coverage
prune docs
# (2) top-level files to omit
exclude .coveragerc
# (3) file types (path patterns) to skip everywhere
global-exclude *.py[cod]
global-exclude __pycache__
    # principles:
    #    - common directories, files and file-types to be generally ignored
    #        - all outside version control, temporary non-coding output and cache data
    #             produced by dev processes, automation or user tools
    #    - by having this section LAST, it can remove files which might have been added by
    #        previous sections -- such as python compiler cache files
    #    - can include this section as **boilerplate** :
    #        - won't all exist in every repo, but including them all does no harm
