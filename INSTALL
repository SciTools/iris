Installing Iris currently requires you to build it from source. The 
latest release is available from https://github.com/scitools/iris.

Iris makes use a range of other libraries and python modules. These 
dependencies must be in place before you can successfully install 
Iris. Once you have satisfied the requirements detailed below, 
extract the iris source package, cd to the new directory, and enter::

  python setup.py install


Details of the setup.py options and commands can be found by entering::

  python setup.py --help

and::

Build requirements
==================

These are external packages which you will need to install before
installing Iris. 


Many of these packages are available in Linux package managers
such as aptitude and yum. For example, it may be possible to install 
Numpy using::

  apt-get install python-numpy

If you are installing dependencies with a package manager on Linux, 
you may need to install the development packages (look for a "-dev" 
postfix) in addition to the core packages.

    Iris requires Python 2.7 or later, but is not currently compatible with Python 3.

numpy 1.6 or later (http://numpy.scipy.org/)

scipy 0.10 or later (http://www.scipy.org/)
    Python package for scientific computing.

udunits2 2.1.24 or later (http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/udunits/udunits-2/udunits2.html)

Packed PP
=========
The libmo_unpack library can be used by Iris for decoding/unpacking 
PP files or Fields files that use an lbpack value of 1 or 4. This 
library is open source, licensed under the 2-clause BSD licence. 
It can be obtained from http://puma.nerc.ac.uk/trac/UM_TOOLS/wiki/unpack.

Use of this library is not enabled by default. If this library is 
available its use can be enabled by installing Iris with the following 
command::

  python setup.py --with-unpack install

Note that if this library and/or its associated header files are installed 
in a custom location then additional compiler arguments may need to be 
passed in to ensure that the Python extension module linking against it 
builds correctly::

  python setup.py --with-unpack build_ext -I <custom include dir> \ 
        -L <custom link-time libdir> -R <custom runtime libdir> install


Packaged Distributions
=======================

The Enthought Python Distribution `(EPD)
<http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php>`_ for Windows, OS X or
Redhat provides some of the dependencies for Iris as does `Python (x, y)
<http://www.pythonxy.com/>`_ which tends to be updated a
bit more frequently.
