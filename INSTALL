You can either install Iris using the conda package manager or from source.

Installing using conda
----------------------

Iris is available using conda for the following platforms:
 * Linux 32-bit and 64-bit,
 * Mac OSX 64-bit, and
 * Windows 32-bit and 64-bit.

To install Iris using conda, you must first download and install conda,
for example from http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html.

Once conda is installed, you can install Iris using conda on any platform with
the following command::

  conda install -c scitools iris

Further documentation on using conda and the features it provides can be found
at http://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html.


Installing from source
----------------------

The latest Iris source release is available from
https://github.com/SciTools/iris.

Iris makes use of a range of other libraries and python modules. These 
dependencies must be in place before you can successfully install 
Iris. Once you have satisfied the requirements detailed below, 
extract the iris source package, cd to the new directory, and enter::

  python setup.py install


In-place build - an alternative for developers
==============================================
We strongly encourage people to contribute to Iris and for this type of 
development activity an in-place build can be useful. Once you've cloned 
the Iris git repository you can perform an in-place build by entering::

  python setup.py std_names
  python setup.py build_ext --inplace

Details of other setup.py options and commands can be found by entering::

  python setup.py --help

and::

  python setup.py --help-commands


Build and runtime requirements
==============================
These are external packages which you will need to have installed before
installing and running Iris. 

Many of these packages are available in Linux package managers
such as aptitude and yum. For example, it may be possible to install 
Numpy using::

  apt-get install python-numpy

If you are installing dependencies with a package manager on Linux, 
you may need to install the development packages (look for a "-dev" 
postfix) in addition to the core packages.  

python 2.7 or later (http://www.python.org/)
    Iris requires Python 2.7 or later, but is not currently compatible with
    Python 3.

    Python package for installing/removing python packages.


Optional
''''''''
These are optional packages which you may want to install to enable
additonal Iris functionality such as plotting and
loading/saving GRIB. These packages are required for the full Iris test
suite to run.

gdal 1.9.1 or later (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/)

    edition 2 messages. A compression library such as Jasper is required 
    to read JPEG2000 compressed GRIB2 files.

matplotlib 1.2.0 (http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)
    Python package for 2D plotting.  

mock 1.0.1 (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mock/)
    Python mocking and patching package for testing. Note that this package
    is only required to support the Iris unit tests.

nose 1.1.2 or later (http://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)
    Python package for software testing. Iris is not compatible with nose2.

pep8 1.4.6* (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8) 
    Python package for software testing.

pandas 0.11.0 or later (http://pandas.pydata.org)
    Python package providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and
    data analysis tools.

PythonImagingLibrary 1.1.7 or later (http://effbot.org/zone/pil-index.htm)
    Python package for image processing.

pyugrid 0.1.1 or later (https://github.com/pyugrid/pyugrid)
    A Python API to utilize data written using the unstructured grid
    UGRID conventions.

shapely 1.2.14 (https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely)
    Python package for the manipulation and analysis of planar geometric
    objects.

* Those packages have been tested with a specific build.

Packed PP
=========
The libmo_unpack library can be used by Iris for decoding/unpacking 
PP files or Fields files that use an lbpack value of 1 or 4. This 
library is open source, licensed under the 2-clause BSD licence. 
It can be obtained from http://puma.nerc.ac.uk/trac/UM_TOOLS/wiki/unpack.

Use of this library is not enabled by default. If this library is 
available its use can be enabled by installing Iris with the following 
command::

  python setup.py --with-unpack install

Note that if this library and/or its associated header files are installed 
in a custom location then additional compiler arguments may need to be 
passed in to ensure that the Python extension module linking against it 
builds correctly::

  python setup.py --with-unpack build_ext -I <custom include dir> \ 
        -L <custom link-time libdir> -R <custom runtime libdir> install


Custom site configuration
=========================
The default site configuration values can be overridden by creating the file
``iris/etc/site.cfg``. For example, the following snippet can be used to
specify a non-standard location for your udunits library::

  [System]
  udunits2_path = /path/to/libudunits2.so

An example configuration file is available in ``iris/etc/site.cfg.template``.
See :py:func:`iris.config` for further configuration options.


Packaged distributions
======================
The Enthought Python Distribution (EPD)
http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php for Windows, OS X or
Redhat provides some of the dependencies for Iris as does `Python (x, y)
http://www.pythonxy.com/ which tends to be updated a
bit more frequently.
