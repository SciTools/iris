r"""Identification of multi-dimensional structure in a flat sequence of homogeneous objects.

The purpose of this module is to provide utilities for the identification
of multi-dimensional structure in a flat sequence of homogeneous objects.

One application of this is to efficiently identify a higher dimensional
structure from a sorted sequence of PPField instances; for an example, given
a list of 12 PPFields, identification that there are 3 unique "time" values
and 4 unique "height" values where time and height are linearly independent
means that we could construct a resulting cube with a shape of
``(3, 4) + <shape of a single field>``.

An example using numpy arrays:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> orig_x, orig_y = np.arange(2), np.arange(3)
    >>> x, y = np.meshgrid(orig_x, orig_y)

    >>> # Remove the dimensional structure from the arrays.
    >>> x, y = x.flatten(), y.flatten()

    >>> print(x)
    [0 1 0 1 0 1]
    >>> print(y)
    [0 0 1 1 2 2]

    >>> arrays = {'x': x, 'y': y}
    >>> group = GroupStructure.from_component_arrays(arrays)
    >>> print(group)
    Group structure:
      Length: 6
      Element names: x, y
      Possible structures ("c" order):
        (y: 3; x: 2)

    >>> built_arrays = group.build_arrays((3, 2), arrays)
    >>> y_array, y_axes = built_arrays['y']
    >>> print(y_array, y_axes)
    [0 1 2] (0,)

    Represents the identified structure of an array, where stride is the
    step between each unique value being seen in order in the flattened
    version of the array.

    Note: Stride is **not** in bytes, but is instead the number of objects in
    the original list of arrays, thus, stride is dtype independent.

    For column major (aka "F" order) arrays, stride will be one for those
    arrays which vary over the first dimension, and conversely will be one for
    C order arrays when varying over the last dimension.

    Constructing an ArrayStructure is most frequently done through the
    :meth:`ArrayStructure.from_array` class method, which takes a flattened
    array as its input.
