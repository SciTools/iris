def _angle(p, q, r):
    """Estimate grid-angles to true-Eastward direction.

    Estimate grid-angles to true-Eastward direction from positions in the same
    grid row, but at increasing column (grid-Eastward) positions.

    {P, Q, R} are locations of consecutive points in the same grid row.
    These could be successive points in a single grid, e.g.::

        {T(i-1,j), T(i,j), T(i+1,j)}

    or a mixture of U/V and T gridpoints if row positions are aligned, e.g::

        {v(i,j), f(i,j), v(i+1,j)}.

    Method:

        Calculate dot product of a unit-vector parallel to P-->R, unit-scaled,
        with the unit eastward (true longitude) vector at Q.
        This value is cos(required angle).
        Discriminate between +/- angles by comparing latitudes of P and R.
        Return NaN where any P-->R are zero.

        .. note::

            This method assumes that the vector PR is parallel to the surface
            at the longitude of Q, as it uses the length of PR as the basis for
            the cosine ratio.
            That is only exact when Q is at the same longitude as the midpoint
            of PR, and this typically causes errors which grow with increasing
            gridcell angle.
            However, we retain this method because it reproduces the "standard"
            gridcell-orientation-angle arrays found in files output by the CICE
            model, which presumably uses an equivalent calculation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    p, q, r : float array
        Arrays of angles, in degrees.
        All the same shape.
        Shape is (2, <input_points_dimensions>).
        Longitudes / latitudes are in array[0 / 1].

    Returns
    -------
    float array
        Grid angles relative to true-East, in degrees.
        Positive when grid-East is anticlockwise from true-East.
        Shape is same as <input_points_dimensions>.

def gridcell_angles(x, y=None, cell_angle_boundpoints="mid-lhs, mid-rhs"):
    """Calculate gridcell orientations for an arbitrary 2-dimensional grid.

    The input grid is defined by two 2-dimensional coordinate arrays with the
    same dimensions (ny, nx), specifying the geolocations of a 2D mesh.

    Input values may be coordinate points (ny, nx) or bounds (ny, nx, 4).
    However, if points, the edges in the X direction are assumed to be
    connected by wraparound.

    Input can be either two arrays, two coordinates, or a single cube
    containing two suitable coordinates identified with the 'x' and 'y' axes.

    The inputs (x [,y]) can be different, see the parameters section.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : :class:`~iris.cube.Cube`
        A grid cube with 2D X and Y coordinates, identified by 'axis'.
        The coordinates must be 2-dimensional with the same shape.
        The two dimensions represent grid dimensions in the order Y, then X.
    x, y : :class:`~iris.coords.Coord`
        X and Y coordinates, specifying grid locations on the globe.
        The coordinates must be 2-dimensional with the same shape.
        The two dimensions represent grid dimensions in the order Y, then X.
        If there is no coordinate system, they are assumed to be true
        longitudes and latitudes.  Units must convertible to 'degrees'.
    x, y : 2-dimensional arrays of same shape (ny, nx)
        Longitude and latitude cell center locations, in degrees.
        The two dimensions represent grid dimensions in the order Y, then X.
    x, y : 3-dimensional arrays of same shape (ny, nx, 4)
        Longitude and latitude cell bounds, in degrees.
        The first two dimensions are grid dimensions in the order Y, then X.
        The last index maps cell corners anticlockwise from bottom-left.
    cell_angle_boundpoints : str, default="mid-lhs, mid-rhs"
        Controls which gridcell bounds locations are used to calculate angles,
        if the inputs are bounds or bounded coordinates.
        Valid values are 'lower-left, lower-right', which takes the angle from
        the lower left to the lower right corner, and 'mid-lhs, mid-rhs' which
        takes an angles between the average of the left-hand and right-hand
        pairs of corners.  The default is 'mid-lhs, mid-rhs'.

    Returns
    -------
    2-dimensional cube
        Cube of angles of grid-x vector from true Eastward direction for
        each gridcell, in degrees.
        It also has "true" longitude and latitude coordinates, with no
        coordinate system.
        When the input has coords, then the output ones are identical if
        the inputs are true-latlons, otherwise they are transformed
        true-latlon versions.
        When the input has bounded coords, then the output coords have
        matching bounds and centrepoints (possibly transformed).
        When the input is 2d arrays, or has unbounded coords, then the
        output coords have matching points and no bounds.
        When the input is 3d arrays, then the output coords have matching
        bounds, and the centrepoints are an average of the 4 boundpoints.

        Units must be angular, i.e. can be converted to 'radians'.
        If not provided, grid angles are estimated from 'u_cube' using the
